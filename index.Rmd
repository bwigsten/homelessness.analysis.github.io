### Introduction
Over 500,000 individuals experience homelessness in the United States on a daily basis. Homelessness continues to be a recalcitrant public health epidemic in the United States, as barriers to health care and affordable housing results in high rates of chronic physical and mental health conditions, comorbid disorders, and overuse of emergency services, driving increased treatment costs. Additionally, homelessness varies by geographic regions, concentrated in populous states, and states with the highest housing costs in the country. Throughout the past decade, national counts of individuals experiencing homelessness have trended downward over time, with more substantial progress evidence within subgroups. The purpose of this analysis is to examine trends in homelessness over time, and explore the influence of various covariates on rates of homelessness. Understanding where homelessness is located and the various factors at play can identify points for public health intervention.


### Data Source
The primary data source for this analysis comes the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD Exchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5783/2018-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us/). This dataset spans from 2007-2018, and includes point-in-time and housing inventory counts at the national and state level, as well as information on the national Continuum of Care (CoC) Program, designed to promote communitywide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness through providing funding for for nonprofit providers, rehousing individuals experiencing homelessness, and increase access and utilization of existing programs. In addition to estimates of homelessness, HUD also collects estimates on sheltered vs unsheltered homelessness, homeless family, chronic homeless, homeless veterans, and homeless youth. 

Additional employment and education covariates used in secondary analysis were pulled from the United State's Census Bureau's [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml).
