### Introduction


### Data Source
The primary data source for this analysis comes the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD Exchange](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5783/2018-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us/). This dataset spans from 2007-2018, and includes point-in-time and housing inventory counts at the national and state level, as well as information on the national Continuum of Care (CoC) Program, designed to promote communitywide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness through providing funding for for nonprofit providers, rehousing individuals experiencing homelessness, and increase access and utilization of existing programs. In addition to estimates of homelessness, HUD also collects estimates on sheltered vs unsheltered homelessness, homeless family, chronic homeless, homeless veterans, and homeless youth. Additional employment and education covariates used in secondary analysis were pulled from the United State's Census Bureau's [American Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml).
